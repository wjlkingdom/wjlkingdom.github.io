> *It's morning. And morning is amazing. It's when we charge into the future. When we blasted off for the moon.*    
*Scaled the highest peak. And flew for the very first time. Morning starts, and changes everything.*    
*It's a clean slate. A fresh start.*   
*So come dreamers, and trailblazers, champions. Come builders.*       
*It's morning, wake up, and be amazing.*
