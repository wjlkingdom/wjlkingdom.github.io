I am **Yanran Li**, a Research Assistant now at PolyU (Hong Kong). 

On this blog, I mostly write about Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning, Social Network Analysis, Applied Machine Learning and Optimization and issues with *R* language.

I was an undergraduate from the Centre of Information Science, School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science(EECS), Peking University. I work with [Prof. Sujian Li](http://www.icl.pku.edu.cn/member/lisujian/) and [Prof. Wenjie Li](http://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~cswjli/). I also do some research at Microsoft as **Applied Researcher and Developer**.

As I didn't want my about page to be a direct result of boredom, I concluded that the best way I can think of to describe myself is to list all of the things that make me happy. So in no particular order, here it goes: 

**Books (mostly Literatures). Arts (I also paint). Running. Family & Friends. Traveling. A good Sunday sunshine. Hand lettering. Coffee. Dancing (I used to dance). Gardening (I'd like to be my career). The smell of fresh flowers.**






       

                 

> *It's morning. And morning is amazing. It's when we charge into the future. When we blasted off for the moon.*    
*Scaled the highest peak. And flew for the very first time. Morning starts, and changes everything.*    
*It's a clean slate. A fresh start.*   
*So come dreamers, and trailblazers, champions. Come builders.*       
*It's morning, wake up, and be amazing.*
